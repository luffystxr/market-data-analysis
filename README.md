# 📈 Market Data Analysis & SMA Backtesting

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to collect cryptocurrency market data from the Binance exchange using the **CCXT** library, perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with Python, and implement a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover strategy** for basic backtesting.

It aligns with skills required for roles involving:
- Python-based financial data analysis
- Time-series handling
- Trading API integration
- Backtesting strategies

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetch historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from Binance.
- Perform EDA with `pandas` and `matplotlib` to visualize market trends.
- Implement a **20-day / 50-day SMA crossover strategy**.
- Generate trading signals (Buy/Sell) based on SMA crossover.
- Calculate **cumulative returns** of the strategy.
- Modular code for easy reusability.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `ccxt` → Market data collection from Binance  
  - `pandas` → Data manipulation & analysis  
  - `matplotlib` → Data visualization

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/market-data-analysis.git
cd market-data-analysis
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Data Fetch Script**

```bash
python src/data_fetch.py
```

---

## 📊 Usage in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open `notebooks/market_analysis.ipynb`.
2. Import functions from `src/` scripts.
3. Fetch market data, perform EDA, run backtesting, and visualize results.

Example:

```python
from src.data_fetch import fetch_binance_data
from src.backtest import apply_sma_strategy
from src.eda import plot_price, plot_sma

# Fetch data
df = fetch_binance_data()

# Apply strategy
df = apply_sma_strategy(df)

# Plot
plot_price(df)
plot_sma(df)
```

## 📈 Example Output

* Price trend over time
* SMA 20 vs. SMA 50 crossover chart
* Cumulative returns plot

If you want, I can also **generate sample SMA crossover charts & output images** for your repo so your README looks visually attractive when recruiters see it.  
Do you want me to add those image examples?
